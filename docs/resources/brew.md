# installer_brew (Resource)

`installer_brew` manages an application using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

It works on systems that use Homebrew as the package management system. Adding an `installer_brew` resource means that Terraform will ensure that the application defined in the `name` argument is made available via brew.

## Example Usage

### Basic usage

```terraform
resource "installer_brew" "basic" {
  name = "cowsay"
}
```

### Taps (Third-Party Repositories)

Install a Homebrew tap using its fully qualified name.

```terraform
resource "installer_brew" "tap" {
  name = "knqyf263/pet/pet"
}
```

### Casks

Install a Homebrew cask using the `cask=true` argument.

```terraform
resource "installer_brew" "cask" {
  name = "neovide"
  cask = true
}
```

Install a Homebrew tap using its fully qualified name.

```terraform
resource "installer_brew" "cask_fqn" {
  name = "homebrew/cask/alfred"
}
```
